        The kickstart file is a file that answers the questions asked during a normal installation of ubuntu. One can use such a file to preform an automated installation.
        To use the file put it on a (local) web or ftp server and remember the ip address. Then start the machine that you want to preform the installation on with the installation media already connected.<br>
        When you see a menu like the one below press the <key>⇥ Tab</key> key.

    <p>
        In the menu entry append <i>ks=http://example.com/ks.cfg</i> with example.com replaced by your ip address. Then press <key>⏎ Enter</key> and wait until it finishes, asks a question or fails.
        If it fails your file is likely incomplete in a way it cannot ask you what it is missing.
